\section{CACLA}
A well established algorithm in Reinforcement Learning is Continuous Actor Critic Learning Automaton (CACLA) \cite{van2007reinforcement}. The algorithm is capable of dealing with continuous state and action spaces. It implements an Actor Critic system in which both the Actor and the Critic are operationalized using a Multi-Layer Perceptron.
